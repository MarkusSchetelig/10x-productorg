# Top 25 Challenges on the Journey to AI at Scale

1. **Vision Without a Map** — No crisp, shared AI vision tied to measurable business outcomes leaves teams pulling in different directions.  
2. **Endless Pilots That Never Launch** — Small tests keep running with no clear success criteria or plan to move into real use.  
3. **Portfolio by Loudest Voice** — Absent transparent impact/effort prioritization, investments skew to opinions over evidence.  
4. **Confusing AI Features** — People don’t understand what the AI does or how to fix mistakes, so they don’t trust it.  
5. **Experiments Without Stop/Scale Rules** — Shipping features without hypotheses, metrics, and decision thresholds wastes time and signals.  
6. **Swamps, Not Lakehouses** — Poorly governed, low-quality, undiscoverable data blocks reuse and slows every initiative.  
7. **No Data Agreements Between Teams** — Without clear owners, quality rules, and handover checklists, data breaks and work must be redone.  
8. **Confusing Metrics and Definitions** — Teams use different definitions and dashboards, so they argue about numbers instead of improving results.  
9. **Privacy-by-Design Gaps** — Weak zero-trust access, masking, and residency controls turn every use case into a compliance fire drill.  
10. **Model Monoculture** — Betting on a single model undermines fit, cost, latency, and the ability to re-benchmark as the landscape shifts.  
11. **Agent Spaghetti** — Ad-hoc tool orchestration without an agent platform and standards kills reliability and debuggability.  
12. **Prompt Drift & Eval Debt** — Treating prompts like magic instead of versioned, tested assets causes regressions you can’t detect or roll back.  
13. **Outdated Knowledge Sources** — The documents and data your AI relies on are old or poorly managed, leading to wrong or incomplete answers.  
14. **Hard to See Performance and Costs** — Missing monitoring and cost tracking hide errors and spending, so bills grow without control.  
15. **Compliance Added Too Late** — Privacy and AI rules (like GDPR and the EU AI Act) are bolted on at the end, causing delays and rework.  
16. **Inventory Black Holes** — No live registry, model cards, lineage, or logs slows audits and weakens provenance.  
17. **Bias & Robustness Blind Spots** — Lacking systematic fairness, robustness, privacy, and adversarial testing invites harm and incidents.  
18. **Automating a Broken Process** — If the process is unclear or wasteful, automation only makes the problems faster and bigger.  
19. **Humans Out of the Loop** — Undefined human-in-the-loop thresholds, escalation paths, and override design put outcomes and trust at risk.  
20. **Fragile Workflows** — Steps fail easily because there are no retries, clear logs, or backup actions when something goes wrong.  
21. **RACI Roulette** — Murky decision rights, slow forums, and unclear escalation stall risky changes and cross-team work.  
22. **Playbook Vacuum** — Absent concise, opinionated playbooks and readiness checks, every team reinvents the basics.  
23. **Skills Gap** — People lack practical training (e.g., writing good AI instructions and checking outputs), which causes mistakes and slows progress.  
24. **Siloed Knowledge** — Without a taxonomy, knowledge hub, and prompt library, lessons stay local and duplication explodes.  
25. **Incentives Fight Learning** — Recognition and advancement aren’t tied to safe experimentation and sharing, so the culture stalls.
