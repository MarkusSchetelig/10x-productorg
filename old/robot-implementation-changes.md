# Robot Implementation Changes

## Summary
The robot has been changed from section-specific implementations to a single global fixed-position robot that appears at the bottom-right corner of the viewport, regardless of which section the user is viewing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified RobotCTA Component
- Removed `sectionName`, `isFixed`, and `isInSection` props
- Component now always uses fixed positioning
- Simplified animation logic - robot is either visible or hidden

### 2. Global State Management
- Replaced section-specific state (`showRobotCTA` object with 7 sections) with global state
- New state variables:
  - `showGlobalRobot`: Controls if robot feature is enabled
  - `robotVisible`: Controls current visibility based on scroll behavior

### 3. Unified Behavior
- Robot appears after 5 seconds on page load
- Hides when user starts scrolling
- Reappears 3 seconds after scrolling stops
- Always positioned at bottom-right of viewport (40px offset)

### 4. Removed Section-Specific Logic
- Deleted individual robot instances from each section
- Removed special handling for pillars section
- Single robot instance now serves entire page

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the application at http://localhost:5174/
2. Wait 5 seconds - the robot should appear at bottom-right
3. Scroll anywhere on the page - robot should disappear
4. Stop scrolling and wait 3 seconds - robot should reappear
5. The robot should maintain the same viewport position regardless of which section you're viewing

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same robot behavior across all sections
- **Simplicity**: Much simpler code with less state management
- **User Experience**: Robot is always accessible from the same location
- **Performance**: Single robot instance instead of multiple per section
